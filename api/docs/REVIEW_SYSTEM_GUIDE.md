const isVerifiedBuyer = await checkVerifiedBuyer(userId, productVariantId);
```

### Rating Calculation
```javascript
// Atomic updates to denormalized rating fields
await calculateAndSaveProductVariantRatings(productVariantId);
```

### Report Management
```javascript
// Automatic flagging when report threshold is reached
if (review.reported_count >= 3) {
  review.status = 'FLAGGED';
}
```

### Content Validation
```javascript
// Automatic content risk assessment
const validation = validateReviewContent(reviewText);
if (validation.riskScore > 2) {
  review.status = 'PENDING_APPROVAL';
}
```

3. **Rating Calculation** - Ensure ProductVariant and Product models have rating fields
4. **Report Count Mismatch** - Check ReviewReport post-save/remove middleware

### Debug Commands

# Test model loading
node -e "require('./models/ProductReview'); console.log('ProductReview loaded');"

# Test helper functions
node -e "const helpers = require('./utils/reviewHelpers'); console.log('Helpers loaded');"

# Check database connection
node test_review_integration.js
```
